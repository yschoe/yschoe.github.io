A very interesting paper that investigated what led to the evolution of two prevalent forms of visual systems: (1) compound eye, and (2) camera-like eye. TLDR: (1) is driven by the need to guide navigation and (2) by the need for object discrimination. 

Lots of more interesting stuff of evolution of lens-like mechanisms and scaling. 
[YC] Thoughts: the motor aspect needs more consideration. Camera-like eyes are generally independently movable, separate from the head, regardless (vertebrates, and even cephalopods), but compound eyes are mostly stuck to the head (insects, arthropods : one exception is the jumping spiders, where the lens is stuck to the head, but their retina at the end of the lens tube moves using a system of muscles).
