A very interesting paper that investigated what led to the evolution of two prevalent forms of visual systems: (1) compound eye, and (2) camera-like eye. TLDR: (1) is driven by the need to guide navigation and (2) by the need for object discrimination. Lots of more interesting stuff of evolution of lens-like mechanisms and scaling.
