A very profound essay on the nature of memory, by philosopher Victoria Trumbull. 



"A genuine science of memory would begin by questioning the storage metaphor itself. Perhaps memories are not stored “anywhere.” Perhaps the brain’s role is not to house the past, but to facilitate our engagement with it."

You can also take a look at my essay where I also raise issues regarding the concepts of memory  and representation. [https://yschoe.github.io/pub/choe-innsbook2023-preprint.pdf](https://yschoe.github.io/pub/choe-innsbook2023-preprint.pdf)
