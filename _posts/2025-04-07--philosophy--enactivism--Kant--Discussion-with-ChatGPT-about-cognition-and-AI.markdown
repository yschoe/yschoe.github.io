I spoke with ChatGPT about philosophical issues on current AI and cognitive science.



Kant and the current paradigm in AI and cognitive science based on the central paradigm of representation

Some alternative philosophical views (Bergson, Merleau-ponty, Gibson, ...), including enactivism, embodied cognition, ecological psychology, etc.

My long term belief: We need to go beyond Kant to make true progress in AI/cognitive science.
