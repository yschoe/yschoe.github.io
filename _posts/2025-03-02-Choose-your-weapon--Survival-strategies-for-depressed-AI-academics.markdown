How to survive as an academic AI researcher in the age of huge AI models.

give up!

try scaling anyway

scale down

reuse and remaster

analysis instead of synthesis

RL! No Data!

Small models! No compute!

Work on specialized application areas of domaing

Solve problems few care about (for now!)

Try things that should not work

Do things that have bad optics

Start it up; spin it out

Collaborate, or jump ship!
